===============================================

> My collection of math problems & solutions written in LaTeX

Currently, the complete PDF contains the solutions of the following problems:

* Integral of the circle function
* The Gaussian integral
* Step-by-step solution of the Logistic ordinary differential equation
* Integral of the _sinc_ function (commonly used in DSP)
* Integral of the function `1/(x^4+1)`
* Derivation of Euler's formula
* Derivation of Fourier's series

In the future, I plan to write my explanations for these problems.

* Parseval's theorem
* &zeta;(2) and &zeta;(4)
* Calculation of a matrix exponential
* Proof of Convolution theorem
